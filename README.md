3. Create an account & enjoy!

## Optimizations


One of the first things I would optimize is the overall data architecture to make the app more scalable. Also I would include a good global state management API such as React Query to better handle Data Fetching from Firebase. Overall, I would design everything differently, as I learned a lot after completing this project!

## Lessons Learned:

Separation of concerns is really helpful and important (most of the time) when dealing with any kind of component. I also learned that handling data can get messy real quick and that you need good a good plan and precise data architecture. Overall I learned a lot during the development of this project and it was a lot of fun.
